### Project 1
Color Segmentation using GMM
color segmentation, bayer filter, image acquisition, color-space
#### Estimation
Estimating p(Cl|x) directly is too difficult. Luckily, we have Bayes rule to rescue us! Bayes rule applied onto p(Cl|x) gives us the following:
p(Cl|x)=p(x|Cl)p(Cl)âˆ‘li=1p(x|Ci)p(Ci)
p(Cl|x) is the conditional probability of a color label given the color observation and is called the Posterior. p(x|Cl) is the conditional probability of color observation given the color label and is generally called the Likelihood. 
#### Color Classification using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)
In this case, one has to come up with a wierd looking fancy function to bound the color which is generally mathematically very difficult and computationally very expensive. 
### Project 2 Panorama Stitching
Stitching multiple images seemlessly to create a panorama
### Project 3 Rotobrush
local classifiers, color confidence, shape confidence, local boundary deformation
### Project 4 SfM or SLAM
Structure from Motion (SfM) or Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
